      question: "What features are available?",
      answer: "The most notable features include a simple bell schedule, a calendar of all district events, and a link page where there are easy and quick to access links. This will definitely be expanded in the future, but this is what is available for now."
    },

      question: "What is the purpose of this app?",
      answer: "The primary and original purpose of this app was to provide a simple and easy way to access bell schedules online without having to go to an official school or district website. This objective has expanded to accommodate for multiple different feature sets."
